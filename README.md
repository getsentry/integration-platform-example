# Integration Platform Example

So you want to integrate with the [Sentry Integration Platform](https://docs.sentry.io/product/integrations/integration-platform/). Great! We're looking forward to it ðŸŽ‰ That's why we built out this codebase; clone/fork away!.

This repository contains some basic starter code to act as a tool/reference for you to refer back to. In it, we'll be covering the following features:

- Handling Installation (with OAuth)
- Refreshing Tokens
- Verifying Installations
- Handling Uninstallations
- Handling Webhooks
- UI Components
  - Issue Creating/Linking
  - Stack Trace Linking
  - Alert Rule Actions

If we missed something, or you're still having trouble, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/sentry-ecosystem/integration-platform-example/issues), and we'll see what we can do! Happy Developing!

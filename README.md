# Integration Platform Example

So you want to integrate with the [Sentry Integration Platform](https://docs.sentry.io/product/integrations/integration-platform/). Great! We're looking forward to it ðŸŽ‰ 
That's why we built out this codebase; clone and fork away!

This repository contains some basic starter code to act as a tool or reference for you to refer back to. In it, we'll be covering the following features:

- Handling Installation (with OAuth)
- Refreshing Tokens
- Verifying Installations
- Handling Uninstallations
- Handling Webhooks
  - Issues
  - Comments
  - Alerts
- UI Components
  - Issue Linking
  - Alert Rule Actions

If we missed something, or you're still having trouble, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/sentry-ecosystem/integration-platform-example/issues), and we'll see what we can do! Happy Developing!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
  - [Sentry](https://sentry.io) - You must be either a Manager or Owner of an organization on Sentry.
  - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) - You must have Docker installed on your local machine.
  - Select a codebase - This demo application comes with a mock frontend and a choice between two backends, one in Node (Express, Sequelize, TypeScript) and another in Python (Flask, SQLAlchemy). Pick the commands and environment that is more appropriate for your implementation.
  - (Optional) A local PostgreSQL DB Client - Great for debugging, removing/editing select data, viewing changes on objects. We suggest [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/).

### Step 0: Choose an Integration

Before setting anything up, you must determine the type of integration you're building on Sentry's [Integration Platform](https://docs.sentry.io/product/integrations/integration-platform/). 

[Public integrations](https://docs.sentry.io/product/integrations/integration-platform/#public-integrations) are meant to be accessed by all Sentry Customers, regardless of whether or not they belong to your organization. 

If you only wish to provide an application to your team or organization, you should probably develop an [Internal integration](https://docs.sentry.io/product/integrations/integration-platform/#public-integrations). These are far easier to get up and running, as they skip the OAuth installation process and become immediately available for webhooks, UI components or API usage.

This tutorial assumes you're building a public integration, but most of the steps are identical for internal integrations unless stated otherwise.

### Step 1: Setup ngrok

To get started, you'll need access to [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). ngrok is a tool which lets you expose your locally running servers to the internet. Since Sentry requires an HTTP connection to your application, this is the easiest way to test changes without having to deploy constantly. You can find [installation instructions here](https://ngrok.com/download).

We recommend setting up [your configuration file](https://ngrok.com/docs#config-location) as follows: 

```yml
authtoken: abc123

tunnels:
  acme-frontend:
    proto: http
    # Make sure addr matches REACT_APP_PORT in .env
    addr: 3000 
  acme-backend-py:
    proto: http
    # Make sure addr matches FLASK_RUN_PORT in .env
    addr: 5100 
  acme-backend-ts:
    proto: http
    # Make sure addr matches EXPRESS_LISTEN_PORT in .env
    addr: 5200 
```

This will let you easily set up your tunnels with:

```shell
ngrok start --all
```

Otherwise, you can expose ports individually. For example, the default frontend port can

```shell
ngrok http 3000
```

With ngrok running, you'll be presented with an interface that might look like the following:

```
ngrok by @inconshreveable

Session Status      online
Account             Sentry (Plan: Pro)
Version             2.3.40
Region              United States (us)
Web Interface       http://127.0.0.1:4040
Forwarding          https://abc123.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:3000 
Forwarding          https://def456.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:5100 
Forwarding          https://ghi789.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:5200 
Connections         ttl     opn     rt1     rt5     p50     p90
                    42      0       0.00    0.00    0.02    3.88
```

Take a note of the forwarding addresses (ending with `.ngrok.io`), as you'll need them to setup your integration within [Sentry](https://sentry.io/). 

### Step 2: Setup Sentry

In your Sentry instance,

1. Click Settings > Developer Settings > New Public Integration.
2. Give your integration an appropriate name and author.
3. Specify a Webhook and Redirect URL with your ngrok forwarding address. Using the above example, with the python backend, it may look like this:
    - Webhook URL: `https://def456.ngrok.io/api/sentry/webhook/` 
    - Redirect URL: `https://abc123.ngrok.io/sentry/setup/`
> Note: On the free plan for ngrok, if your service restarts, [you will be issued a new forwarding address](https://ngrok.com/docs#getting-started-stable). If this happens, be sure to update these URLs in Sentry to keep your app functional while developing or testing.
4. Ensure 'Verify Installation' is checked.
5. Ensure 'Alert Rule Action' is checked.
6. In the textbox for 'Schema', paste in the entire [`integration-schema.json` file](integration-schema.json)
7. Enable 'Issue & Event - Read' permissions.
8. Enable the webhooks 
   - `issue` (for `created`, `resolved`, `assigned`, and `ignored` actions)
   - `comment` (for `created`, `edited`, and `deleted` actions)
> Note: We aren't enabling `error.created` webhooks for this demo. See more on this decision [here](docs/webhooks/event-webhooks.md#error-webhooks).
9.  Click 'Save Changes'.
10. Make a note of the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

This demo integration can helpfully create errors in Sentry to trigger webhooks while developing, but you'll need to issue this app a DSN. 

1. Click Projects > Create Project.
2. Select React (JS).
3. Give your project an appropriate name (for example: Demo Integration).
4. Click Create Project.
5. Make a note of the **DSN** URL.

Next, we'll be taking these values from Sentry and putting together our application's environment.
### Step 3: Setup your Environment

We've included a `.env.sample` file for you to refer to when building out your environment. To set it up, change the filename from `.env.sample` to `.env`. Now you can change any of these values, but the pay close attention to a few of them:
  - `SENTRY_CLIENT_ID`: The Client ID from Step 2
  - `SENTRY_CLIENT_SECRET`: The Client Secret from Step 2
  - `REACT_APP_SENTRY_DSN`: The DSN from Step 2
  - `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL`: The ngrok forwarding address of your chosen backend

> Note: If you change `REACT_APP_PORT`, `FLASK_RUN_PORT`, or `EXPRESS_LISTEN_PORT`, you may have to reconfigure your ngrok setup and Integration URLs in Sentry

Great, now we're ready to serve our application!
### Step 4: Build and serve the codebase

This example code comes with a mock frontend and a choice between two backends, one in NodeJS (Express + TS) and another in Python (Flask). To launch the application, you'll need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and ensure it is running.

Now you can spin up the project of your choice with:

```bash
make serve-python # A python server built on Flask and SQLAlchemy
# OR
make serve-typescript # A typescript node server built on Express and Sequelize
```

Now the app is ready to test! Consult the [Using your Integration](#using-your-integration) section to playground your application as you make changes and trigger webhooks in Sentry.

If, during development, you make changes to the `.env` file or dependencies, you'll need to rebuild the images with:

```bash
make setup-python
# OR
make setup-typescript
```

## Using your Integration

Building an app on our integration platform gives you access to lots of Sentry features. This section will detail how to go about testing them while building your integration.

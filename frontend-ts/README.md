# Frontend - TypeScript

This directory contains the frontend code written in TypeScript.

It was bootstrapped from [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/). We opted to use Typescript via:
```shell
npx create-react-app frontend-ts --template typescript
```
See more [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/).

Use `npm start` to spin up the app, or `npm run build` to generate production files.
